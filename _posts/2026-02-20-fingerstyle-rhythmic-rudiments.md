## Second-hand knowledge

Guitar instruction is organized around the left hand: chord charts, scale
diagrams, fretboard maps. Intuitive enough. Watch someone play and the left
hand commands the attention: fingers moving across the neck, chord shapes
forming, notes changing. The right hand appears to be doing little more than
triggering what the left hand prepared — a button pusher.

Of course, the right hand is not ignored entirely. Teachers address technique:
how to hold the pick, where to anchor the hand, how classical players shape
their nails and control the angle of attack. Intermediate students working on
speed spend real time on right-hand mechanics: alternate picking, economy
picking, general shredding. But this attention tends to cluster at the
extremes — foundational setup on one end, advanced facility on the other.

Fingerstyle guitar, our genre, does devote some early energy to the right hand
in the form of picking patterns, notably various Travis or roll-based
patterns. A student might learn a few of these or perhaps even a dozen of
them. What tends not to happen, at least outside of classical guitar
education, is a systematic approach to right-hand rhythmic coordination:
developing the ability to play melody notes at any point in a measure while
keeping a desired bass rhythm chugging along.

This post tries to fill that gap with 256 exercises — a number every software
engineer loves. That might seem excessive, a kind of completist insanity. All I
can tell you is that some of the most obvious gains I have made as a
fingerstyle player have followed periods of deliberate right-hand work, most
notably the exercises presented here. Later I will say more about how I worked
on this material.

Collectively, the exercises pose this challenge: can you play any rhythmic
combination of melody 8th notes while keeping a typical alternating bass
going? Drummers build these kinds of coordination skills by practicing
rudiments — the foundational sticking patterns and rhythmic patterns they need
to play a variety of musical styles. This collection of fingerstyle rudiments
has a similar goal. If you can play all of them, you will have the core skills
to quickly learn almost any fingerstyle pattern or melody within an
alternating or steady-bass context on an 8th-note grid.[^1] That is a deep and
broad musical terrain.

## The rudiments explained

The bass is the same across all of the rudiments: the thumb plays alternating
quarter notes, cycling through the root and fifth of whatever chord is
underneath. That is the backbone.

Also constant is the harmony and structure. Every rudiment consists of eight
bars: two each of Am, Dm, E7, and Am again. The chord voicings are
deliberately easy — open chords you already know — and the melody notes are
simple, just two or three notes played on the upper strings. The left hand has
work to do, but not much. Fingerstyle players ranging from beginners through
intermediates will benefit from the coordination skills the rudiments build.
For those closer to the beginner end, one useful simplification is to reduce
the melody to a single string rather than following the notation strictly.

Here is an example — Ex3.13, the Classic Travis pattern — to give you a sense
of what a rudiment looks like:

    alt="Ex3.13: Classic Travis picking rhythm"
    caption="Ex3.13: Classic Travis picking rhythm"
%}

The rudiments are organized by how many times the fingers play per measure.
Call that value N. There is a Guitar Pro file for every value of N from 0
through 8.

When N equals 1, the fingers play a melody note exactly once per bar. There
are eight possible positions for that single note: any of the on-beats (1, 2,
3, or 4) or the off-beats (1&, 2&, 3&, or 4&). Thus the file
"rhythmic-rudiments-ex1.gp" contains eight rudiments, Ex1.1 through Ex1.8.

When N equals 2, the fingers play twice per bar. As you might recall from math
class, the number of possible combinations grows rapidly, giving us Ex2.1
through Ex2.28. The number of combinations peaks when N equals 4 and then
declines in a mirror-like fashion. At the extremes, there is only one possible
arrangement. Here is the full tally:

| N     | Rudiments |
|------:|----------:|
| 0     | 1         |
| 1     | 8         |
| 2     | 28        |
| 3     | 56        |
| 4     | 70        |
| 5     | 56        |
| 6     | 28        |
| 7     | 8         |
| 8     | 1         |
| Total | 256       |

## How to eat an elephant

Nobody picks up a guitar to drill rudiments — we come for the songs. I
approach technical skill-building in small increments: about five minutes at
the start of each practice session. The first time I worked through these
rudiments, I probably spent a few months on them. At the time I was somewhere
in the beginner-to-intermediate range for fingerstyle guitar, so a true
beginner would need to budget more time per rudiment than I did.

Some of these exercises are easy — a session or two and they are done. Others
might take several days. My advice is not to grind on any single one for too
long. Work on it for a bit, set it aside if you are not yet fluent, and come
back the next day. Your brain and hands keep working after you put the guitar
down. Small bits of steady, focused practice can accomplish more than most
people expect.

## Whole elephant too much?

If 256 rudiments sounds like more than you want to tackle, there are a couple
of ways to reduce the scope.

The first, intended for the maximally impatient or time-constrained, is a
bare-bones set of five exercises that represent the essential core of the
fingerstyle, roots-oriented genre, drawn from the family of Travis picking
patterns — "Five fingerstyle rhythmic patterns you MUST know" in the jargon of
our time.

The second is a larger selection, roughly a quarter of the full set,
consisting of the rudiments I found most musically interesting. Both are
described below.

## Travis picking patterns

Some of these rudiments correspond to picking patterns that are well-known in
the fingerstyle world. Start with Ex3.13, which most players would recognize
as the rhythmic structure of the quintessential Travis picking pattern.[^2]

Strip away one melody note and you get Ex2.3, a minimal Travis variant that
sounds great and reveals something important by isolating the defining
characteristics of the style: a melody note on beat 1 paired with a syncopated
melody note on beat 2&. That is the heart of Travis picking.

Going the other direction — adding a melody note — gives us Ex4.30, the
rhythmic shape of the picking pattern used in songs like "Dust in the Wind."
Notice what was added: another syncopated note on beat 4&.

Take one more step and add the final syncopated melody note, on beat 1&, and
you arrive at Ex5.15. I tend to call this the Busy Travis pattern, but it
could also be called the London pattern for convoluted reasons.[^3]

As a final variation, drop the melody note on beat 1 from Busy Travis and you
get Ex4.50 — the rhythmic shape of the outside-inside and inside-outside
patterns described in Mark Hanson's classic "The Art of Solo Fingerpicking."

| Exercise     | Melodic rhythm     | Picking pattern                   |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Ex2.3        | 1, 2&              | Minimal Travis                    |
| Ex3.13       | 1, 2&, 3&          | Classic Travis                    |
| Ex4.30       | 1, 2&, 3&, 4&      | Dust                              |
| Ex5.15       | 1, 1&, 2&, 3&, 4&  | Busy Travis / London              |
| Ex4.50       | 1&, 2&, 3&, 4&     | Outside-inside / Inside-outside   |

## Quarter elephant: my favorites

When I worked through these rudiments a second time, in preparation for
writing this post, I kept a running list of favorites — the rudiments I found
most fun to play, those with clear connections to known picking patterns, and
those that struck me as having obvious musical potential.

If you work through all of the rudiments, you will discover that some of them
are musically quite dull: play a melody note on every downbeat and you get
something mechanical, almost robotic. Others, as N grows large, feel more like
hand calisthenics than music. I worked through all of them and believe they
were useful for skill building, but a fair number felt like chores.

One important caveat: absence from this list should not be read as a negative
musical verdict. These rudiments use a static melody: combine that with a
predictable rhythm and you get boredom. Some truly wonderful picking patterns
— Ex5.15 and Ex4.50 among them — sound unremarkable in the context of a
static-melody rudiment but come alive when the melody moves.

| GP file   | Favorite rudiments                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ex1       | 1, 2, 4                                                     |
| Ex2       | 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27               |
| Ex3       | 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 27, 31, 33, 35, 36, 45, 49, 50     |
| Ex4       | 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 24, 30, 31, 37, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 67, 69 |
| Ex5       | 9, 15, 18, 24, 32, 34, 41, 45, 54                           |
| Ex6       | 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 24, 26                         |

A different way to reduce scope is to focus on the lower values of N. Whether
you aim to practice all 256 rudiments or just the favorites listed above, the
best return on your practice time will come from the first few files. As N
increases beyond 3 or 4, the melodic field becomes dense and the musical
payoff shrinks accordingly (the static-melody caveat still applies).

That said, I found real value in working through the higher-N rudiments. As
the number of melody notes increases, the challenge shifts: you are no longer
training your hands to play; you are training them not to play. The difficulty
becomes protecting the spaces between notes and resisting the pull toward
rhythmic grooves internalized from prior exercises. That is a distinct and
useful skill.

## Finding the music

Whether you tackle all 256 or just a subset, treat each rudiment as a musical
performance, not a drill. Dynamics, articulation, sustain, and palm muting are
all available — use them. Some rhythms work well with a flowing, sustaining
approach. Others sound too busy that way; aggressive muting or staccato can
clarify things. Occasionally a rudiment that feels uninspiring when plucked in
a standard fingerstyle manner becomes interesting when the melody notes are
played with more of a strumming motion (Ex2.27 is one example among many).

When approaching chord changes, strategic muting or staccato can convert a
moment that might sound clumsy into something intentional. This matters most
when melody notes fall on beat 4 or beat 4&, right before the bar line. It is
no accident that the Classic Travis pattern contains no 4& melody note. The
players who developed these patterns were practical musicians who knew what
they were doing.

## When to say when

When have you finished a rudiment? My approach was to set a target tempo and
stop when I could play the exercise with control and accuracy at that speed.
The Guitar Pro files are set at 120 BPM, which is generally where I stopped.
For exercises that were more musically appealing, I sometimes raised the bar.

The right tempo target depends on your goals. Speed was not a primary concern
for me. I have never been drawn to particularly fast playing styles, and my
main objective was basic hand coordination. When raw speed is needed for a
specific song, I tend to address it in context rather than in the abstract.

## Variations to consider or reject

You could extend this work in several directions: single melody notes rather
than intervals, swing eighth notes rather than straight, a steady bass rather
than alternating, or a different chord progression.

The first variation — reducing to a single melody note — is the best
simplification for beginners because it narrows the scope to the core rhythmic
skill: coordinating the alternating thumb with a single, static melody note.

I am less certain about the other variations. I did not practice these
rudiments with swing eighths, though I play a fair amount of music with swing
rhythm. My rough sense is that the coordination skills practiced in straight
time seemed to transfer readily to swing rhythms.

Regarding steady bass: not worth the trouble. Alternating bass is the harder
coordination challenge, and if you can maintain rhythmic independence against
an alternating thumb, steady bass will take care of itself. A beginner might
reach for steady bass as a simplification, but the left hand work here is
already minimalist — dive straight into alternating bass.

Different chord progressions are a more reasonable variation, but I am not
sure they are worth pursuing exhaustively. The progression here already covers
the primary bass-picking motions that appear in much blues, rock, and
traditional fingerstyle music: an Am and a C chord involve the same bass
motion; an E7 and a D chord in drop-D tuning share the same motion. The key
skills here are rhythmic. Once you have the coordination, applying it to new
chords is a left-hand problem.

## The goods

At last, here are the Guitar Pro files: [Ex0][ex0-gp], [Ex1][ex1-gp],
[Ex2][ex2-gp], [Ex3][ex3-gp], [Ex4][ex4-gp], [Ex5][ex5-gp], [Ex6][ex6-gp],
[Ex7][ex7-gp], [Ex8][ex8-gp].

If Guitar Pro is outside your budget there are several applications and
websites that can read and play these files. One worth naming explicitly,
because it is open-source and free, is [TuxGuitar][tux]. It handles most of
what Guitar Pro does.

[^1]: I say "almost" because some musical material involves different
    combinations of right-hand fingering that can feel challenging or
    counterintuitive. But examples like this are not particularly common once
    you have achieved the ability to play the rudiments presented here.

[^2]: Travis picking as a named technique is partly a modern construct. My
    rough understanding is that the historical [Merle Travis][travis] did not
    play using the patterns now called Travis picking. The label came later
    and the patterns were codified by others.

[^3]: The naming gets confusing here. Dan Thorpe, who teaches a pattern he
    calls the London pattern (named after Ralph McTell's "Streets of London"),
    uses that name for what I call the Dust pattern, Ex4.30. However, as best
    I can tell, "Streets of London" mostly uses Busy Travis, Ex5.15, and the
    rhythm of Ex4.30 appears only occasionally in the song — hence my
    attachment of the name London to Ex5.15, not Ex4.30.
