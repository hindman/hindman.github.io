[LoopLlama][loopllama] is a web application to loop and slow down YouTube
videos.

- Create favorites to quickly switch among frequently watched videos.
- Set marks to jump to key spots in the videos.
- Favorites and video settings are remembered.
- Entirely keyboard driven, so no wasted time fiddling with the mouse.
- Built for practicing music, but potentially other uses.
- Inspired by [SlowTube][slowtube].

To get started:

- Copy a YouTube URL.
- Press `u` and paste the URL and enter when prompted.
- Press `h` for help.
- Experiment with the other commands.

Some known issues:

- If you try to load the page for the first time in a browser tab and nothing
  appears, just reload.

- If LoopLlama commands do nothing or do unexpected things you might have
  clicked the video frame, giving it focus for your keyboard actions. Just
  click somewhere outside the video frame to give the focus back to LoopLlama.

- The first time you pause a video, YouTube will display suggested videos that
  will interfere with your view of the screen. Click the X to dismiss the
  suggestions, then click outside the video frame. Future pauses will not block
  your view.

- LoopLlama does not support the less common YouTube URL formats.

- YouTube disallows some videos. They will communicate that explicitly.

- I know Python. Javascript, not so much.
