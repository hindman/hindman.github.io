## What is *The Fifth Fret*?

*The Fifth Fret* is where I publish occasional writing on learning to play
guitar — perhaps with detours into coding, history, or politics. I think of it
as a workshop more than a blog, though some of what appears here may interest
others.

## Who is behind it?

I'm *Monty Hindman*, an amateur guitarist with a background in history, the
social sciences, and software engineering. I've played guitar for about five
decades, casually and intermittently for the first four, but with greater
seriousness and a focus on acoustic fingerstyle during the most recent. I post
new recordings on [YouTube][mh-youtube] roughly once a month.

I studied history and English at the University of Oregon and earned a Ph.D. in
U.S. political and economic history from the University of Michigan. My
dissertation — [*The Rise and Fall of Wealth Taxation*][diss-rfwt] — examines
the history of fiscal politics and policy in the American states, focusing on
the period 1830-1940, during which state governments created a fiscal regime
based on the general property tax and then replaced it with modern tax
instruments like income taxes and especially general sales taxes — shifting the
burden from wealth to mass taxation.

Professionally, I've worked at the intersection of the historical social
sciences, data, and software engineering:

- Managing editor, [*Historical Statistics of the United States: Millennial Edition*][hsus].
- Program manager and software engineer at the Minnesota Population Center ([IPUMS][www-ipums]).
- Software engineer and engineering manager at Apple Maps.
