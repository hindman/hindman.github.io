# Heading 1

All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and
the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing
in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I
suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand
to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was
all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she
must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the
end.

Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds.
It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to
rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into
their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.

## Heading 2

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother
doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite
like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering
humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked
this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her
cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of
sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with
which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of
your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier
thoughts, ready for you to put on.

I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors
sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become
intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind,
which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are
zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are
probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an
island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and
rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes
who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with
six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady
with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also
first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,
hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into
braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and
so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing
through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand
still.

### Heading 3

Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon
with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who
was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a
boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of
leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night,
Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands
have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of
them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores
children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too
have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land
no more.

Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not
large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and
another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and
table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you
go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.

#### Heading 4

Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found
things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the
word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and
Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name
stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling
gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.

## Notices

A notice displays information that explains nearby content. Often used to call
attention to a particular detail.

When using Kramdown `{: .notice}` can be added after a sentence to assign the
`.notice` to the `<p></p>` element. 

**Changes in Service:** We just updated our [privacy policy](#) here to better
service our customers. We recommend reviewing the changes.
{: .notice}

**Primary Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Integer nec odio. [Praesent libero](#). Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi.
Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--primary}

**Info Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipiscing elit](#).
Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi.
Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--info}

**Warning Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
[Integer nec odio](#). Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi.
Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--warning}

**Danger Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipiscing](#)
elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed
nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--danger}

**Success Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi.
Nulla quis sem at [nibh elementum](#) imperdiet.
{: .notice--success}

Want to wrap several paragraphs or other elements in a notice? Using Liquid to
capture the content and then filter it with `markdownify` is a good way to go.

```html
{% raw %}{% capture notice-2 %}
#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}

<div class="notice">{% raw %}{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}{% endraw %}</div>
```

{% capture notice-2 %}

#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-2 | markdownify }}
</div>

Or you could skip the capture and stick with straight HTML.

```html
<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>
```

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>

## Welcome to Jekyll

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and
re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which
launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the
convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front
matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it
works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most
out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub
repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll
Talk][jekyll-talk].
