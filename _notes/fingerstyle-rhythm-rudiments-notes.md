# Fingerstyle Rhythmic Rudiments: Raw Notes

## Research: what experts have said about right-hand rudiments

The strongest precedent for this approach is Giuliani's Op. 1
(120 Right-Hand Studies). It's essentially the same idea:
systematically enumerate right-hand arpeggio patterns over simple
chord changes. Written in 1812, still standard pedagogy. These
exercises do for rhythmic placement what Giuliani did for arpeggio
fingerings.

Classical pedagogues who explicitly argue right-hand primacy:

- Aaron Shearer: his method introduces right-hand free strokes
  before the left hand touches the fretboard. His position is
  that conventional teaching over-emphasizes left-hand note-finding
  at the expense of right-hand tone and rhythm.

- Abel Carlevaro: called the right hand the "voice" of the guitar
  (controls tone, dynamics, articulation). His Serie Didactica
  Cuaderno No. 4 is entirely right-hand work.

- Scott Tennant (Pumping Nylon): has stated that intermediate
  players who plateau usually have a right-hand problem, not a
  left-hand one. His arpeggio chapter enumerates p-i-m-a
  permutations systematically.

- Charles Duncan (The Art of Classical Guitar Playing): argues
  right-hand neglect happens partly because the motions are small,
  less visible, harder to self-diagnose.

- Julio Sagreras (Las Lecciones de Guitarra): early volumes use
  minimal left-hand movement while cycling through dozens of
  right-hand arpeggio figurations -- the implicit pedagogical
  argument being that the right hand needs to become automatic
  before adding left-hand complexity.

- Emilio Pujol (Escuela Razonada de la Guitarra): transmitted
  the Tarrega school's emphasis on right-hand tone quality as
  the defining characteristic of a guitarist's musical identity.

- Ricardo Iznaola (Kitharologus: The Path to Virtuosity): treats
  right-hand development as a distinct technical domain requiring
  its own dedicated practice regimen.

- Christopher Parkening (Guitar Method): structures early lessons
  with heavy emphasis on right-hand exercises before combining
  hands.

Travis picking pedagogy supports the approach directly:

- Mark Hanson (The Art of Contemporary Travis Picking): drills
  thumb alone for weeks before adding melody fingers. The thumb
  must be automatic first.

- Chet Atkins: "the thumb is the drummer." Universal advice from
  Travis teachers: don't rush past the thumb.

- Tommy Emmanuel: describes his practice as largely right-hand
  pattern drilling; his musical vocabulary is fundamentally a
  vocabulary of right-hand patterns.

On the "rudiments" framing specifically: the term is borrowed from
percussion and isn't commonly used in guitar pedagogy, but the
concept is everywhere -- Giuliani's Op. 1, Tennant's permutation
exercises, Sagreras's early volumes. The exercises name something
that has existed unnamed.

The structural argument: most popular guitar instruction is
organized around chords, scales, and songs -- all left-hand-forward.
The right hand is treated as "just strums" or "just picks."
Classical pedagogy does better but still tends toward
repertoire-driven teaching. These exercises address a genuine gap:
systematic, exhaustive right-hand rhythmic drilling in a fingerstyle
context.
