# Fingerstyle Rhythmic Rudiments: Raw Notes

## Other topics to cover

How to eat an elephant:
    - Nobody chooses a musical hobby to work drill rudiments: we come for the
      songs.
    - I approach skill building like this in very small steps.
    - At the start of each practice session I tend to work for about 5 minutes
      on whatever my current technique project happens to be.
    - I probably spent a few months on these rudiments the first time I worked
      through them systematically.
    - At the time I was probably in the beginner-to-intermediate skill range
      for fingerstyle guitar, so someone in the beginning stage would need to
      spend more time per rudiment than I did.
    - In any case, some of the rudiments are easy and can be checked off you
      list after a session or two.
    - Others might takes several days of practice.
    - I don't recommend that you grind on any single exercise for a long time.
      Work on one for a little while. If you are not fluent yet, that's fine.
      Come back the next day and you will probably be a bit better at it. Your
      brain and hands do work over night. Be patient and give them the time to
      perform their magic.
    - Small bits of steady, focused work can accomplish a lot more than you
      might think at first.

What if I'm not crazy enough to eat a whole elephant?
    - I worked through these exercises a second time when preparing to write
      this post.
    - During that second pass, I collected a list the rudiments that were my
      favorites or that seemed most promising musically.
    - If you're looking for a less dauting program, I offer two pathways
      below. One is a bare minimum: "Five picking patterns you MUST know" in
      the jargon of our time.
    - The other my subjective listing of the "greatest hits", which whittles
      the job down to about a quarter of its size.
    - Let's start with the bare minimum.

The family of Travis picking patterns
    - The rhythmic structures of some of these rudiments are found in some of
      the most famous fingerstyle patterns.
    - For example, if we focus on "Travis picking", we can start with Ex3.13,
      which aligns with the picking pattern many people would call the
      quintessential Travis pattern.
    - We can substract one melody note to get Ex2.3, which could be described
      as a minimal variant of Travis picking. This exercise is useful to
      understand because it helps you understand the defining characteristics
      of Travis picking are the melody notes on beat 1 and then the syncopated
      melody note on beat 2&. That's the heart of it.
    - We can go the other direction and add another note to the classic Travis
      pattern. That gives use Ex4.30, which has the rhythmic shape of as the
      well known picking pattern used in songs like Dust in the Wind. This
      pattern also clues you into what we are doing as we augment classic
      Travis: we are adding another syncopated note.
    - Take one more step in that direction and we can add the final syncopated
      melody note (1&), producing Ex5.15 which at various points in my notes I
      have either called the London pattern or the Busy Travis pattern.
      Lately, I lean toward the latter name.
    - Footnote on Thorpe: his London is my Dust-in-wind. The song "Streets of
      London" seems to mostly use my London, but does use my Dust-in-wind for
      some bars.
    - As a final variation to connect these Travis-related patterns to each
      other, we can drop the melody note on beat 1, given us the rhythmic
      shape of Ex4.50. That rhythm aligns with the outside-inside and
      inside-outside picking patterns I learned in my introduction to
      fingerstyle guitar: Mark Hason's "The Art of Solo Fingerpicking".
    - All 5 of these patterns are essential. If you learn nothing else, learn
      them. See table below.

    Exercise | Melodic rhythm | Picking pattern
    -------------------------------------------
    Ex2.3    | 1 2&           | minimal travis
    Ex3.13   | 1 2& 3&        | classic travis
    Ex4.30   | 1 2& 3& 4&     | dust in wind
    Ex5.15   | 1 1& 2& 3& 4&  | london
    Ex4.50   | 1& 2& 3& 4&    | outside-inside; inside-outside

The greatest hits:
    - This listing is subjective.
    - As I worked through the rudiments the second time I kept a list of the
      exercises that seemed the most musically promising.
    - As you'll discover, some of the exercises are musically quite dull: for
      example, play a melody note on every downbeat, robot style.
    - Others are so busy (as N gets large) that you feel a bit like you are
      doing hand exercises more than playing music.
    - I doggedly practiced them all and think they have helped me in building
      skill. But a fair number of the exercises felt more like chores or doing
      push ups.
    - The list below is most not that. They are the rudiments that were fun to
      play, the have known connections to famous picking patterns (the Travis
      examples discussed already), or stuck me as having real musical
      potential.
    - I should emphasize that a rudiment's absense from this list of greatest
      hits should not be interpreted as a negative verdict on its musical
      potential.
    - Remember that these exercises use a static melody. When you combine a
      static melody with a robotically predictable rhythm, you create boredom.
      But some truly great picking patterns (eg Ex5.15 or London and Ex4.50 or
      Outside-inside) sound quite dull in the context of static-melody
      rudiments but absolutely beautiful when the melody is more active.

    Ex2     | 1 3 5 8 9 13 16 17 19 20 21 22 27

Find the music in the rudiments:
    - Whether you tackle all 256 rudiments or just a selected list, try to
      make each one as musical as you can.
    - Treat the dynamics, the melody articulation, sustain, and palm muting as
      dials that you can turn to get as much music as you can out of each
      exercise.
    - Some of the rhythms work fine when played with a flowing, sustaining
      style.
    - Others might sound too busy that way, but aggressive muting or staccato
      at various points can revive them musically.
    - Sometimes a rudiment might be uninspiring when plucked in typical
      fingerstyle fashion, but becomes interesting if the melody notes are
      played in more of a strumming fashion with the fingers.
    - Especially at moments before chord changes, a bit of strategic muting or
      staccato can turn something that sounds clumsy into purposeful musical
      decisions.
    - In that regard, melody notes on beats 4 and especially 4& can be tricky,
      a point that lends to explanatory power to the absence of 4& in the
      Classic Travis picking pattern: the masters were practical and knew what
      they were doing!

When to say when:
    - When have you finished a rudiment?
    - My general approach was to select a target BPM and stop working on a
      rudiment when I felt like I could play it controlled and accurate
      manner.
    - For rudiments that were more appealing musically I probably raised the
      bar a bit. For rudiments that felt like mere physical exercises, I
      tended not to push much beyond the target.
    - What BPM should you select? It depends on your goals. I've never been
      very attracted to super-fast musical styles, so raw speed was not a key
      goal for me.
    - Thus the 120 BPM in these .gp files is generally the tempo where I
      stopped sharpening the pencil.
    - For me the primary goal was to achieve basic hand coordination. If I
      need raw speed I tend to deal with it in a case-by-case way whenever a
      specific song part demands it.

## Research: what experts have said about right-hand rudiments

The strongest precedent for this approach is Giuliani's Op. 1
(120 Right-Hand Studies). It's essentially the same idea:
systematically enumerate right-hand arpeggio patterns over simple
chord changes. Written in 1812, still standard pedagogy. These
exercises do for rhythmic placement what Giuliani did for arpeggio
fingerings.

Classical pedagogues who explicitly argue right-hand primacy:

- Aaron Shearer: his method introduces right-hand free strokes
  before the left hand touches the fretboard. His position is
  that conventional teaching over-emphasizes left-hand note-finding
  at the expense of right-hand tone and rhythm.

- Abel Carlevaro: called the right hand the "voice" of the guitar
  (controls tone, dynamics, articulation). His Serie Didactica
  Cuaderno No. 4 is entirely right-hand work.

- Scott Tennant (Pumping Nylon): has stated that intermediate
  players who plateau usually have a right-hand problem, not a
  left-hand one. His arpeggio chapter enumerates p-i-m-a
  permutations systematically.

- Charles Duncan (The Art of Classical Guitar Playing): argues
  right-hand neglect happens partly because the motions are small,
  less visible, harder to self-diagnose.

- Julio Sagreras (Las Lecciones de Guitarra): early volumes use
  minimal left-hand movement while cycling through dozens of
  right-hand arpeggio figurations -- the implicit pedagogical
  argument being that the right hand needs to become automatic
  before adding left-hand complexity.

- Emilio Pujol (Escuela Razonada de la Guitarra): transmitted
  the Tarrega school's emphasis on right-hand tone quality as
  the defining characteristic of a guitarist's musical identity.

- Ricardo Iznaola (Kitharologus: The Path to Virtuosity): treats
  right-hand development as a distinct technical domain requiring
  its own dedicated practice regimen.

- Christopher Parkening (Guitar Method): structures early lessons
  with heavy emphasis on right-hand exercises before combining
  hands.

Travis picking pedagogy supports the approach directly:

- Mark Hanson (The Art of Contemporary Travis Picking): drills
  thumb alone for weeks before adding melody fingers. The thumb
  must be automatic first.

- Chet Atkins: "the thumb is the drummer." Universal advice from
  Travis teachers: don't rush past the thumb.

- Tommy Emmanuel: describes his practice as largely right-hand
  pattern drilling; his musical vocabulary is fundamentally a
  vocabulary of right-hand patterns.

On the "rudiments" framing specifically: the term is borrowed from
percussion and isn't commonly used in guitar pedagogy, but the
concept is everywhere -- Giuliani's Op. 1, Tennant's permutation
exercises, Sagreras's early volumes. The exercises name something
that has existed unnamed.

The structural argument: most popular guitar instruction is
organized around chords, scales, and songs -- all left-hand-forward.
The right hand is treated as "just strums" or "just picks."
Classical pedagogy does better but still tends toward
repertoire-driven teaching. These exercises address a genuine gap:
systematic, exhaustive right-hand rhythmic drilling in a fingerstyle
context.

## Ideas for intro/motivation

A few distinct angles, each with a sketch of how it could open the
post:

---

3. The diagnosis angle

When a fingerstyle player's timing feels loose, the instinct is to
slow down and work through the chord changes more carefully. That's
usually the wrong diagnosis. The left hand can almost always get to
the right fret in time. The problem is that the right hand doesn't
know exactly when "in time" is. That distinction -- between knowing
the notes and knowing where in the beat they land -- is what these
exercises are designed to expose and correct.

This is concrete and practical. It names a specific failure mode and
positions the exercises as the solution.

---

5. The "what you're actually practicing" angle

When you're working through a piece of music, you're solving several
problems at once: where the left hand goes, what the right hand does,
how the two synchronize, and whether the whole thing holds together
rhythmically. That's a lot to track simultaneously, and it makes it
hard to know which problem is causing the breakdown when something
goes wrong. These exercises strip most of that away. The chord
voicings are simple enough to ignore. The only question is whether
the right-hand rhythm is where you think it is.

This justifies the design choice of using simple chords -- the
deliberate de-emphasis of the left hand.

## Key concept: thumb-finger independence

Independence — the overarching concept your exercises are building.
"Thumb-finger independence" is the standard term for the ability to maintain a
steady thumb pattern while the fingers operate freely against it. This is what
"the thumb is the drummer" is pointing at.

Polyphonic texture / two-voice texture — the musical result of what you're
doing. Bass and melody are two independent voices. Some teachers use
"contrapuntal" loosely in this context. Classical pedagogy talks about
bringing out the melody voice while subordinating the bass, which presupposes
they're genuinely independent.
