## Video

- id: YouTube video ID; the authoritative key used internally

- url: stored as supplied by the user; kept for display and JSON readability,
  not reconstructed from id.

- duration: from YouTube API

- time: current time. Useful so that when you return to the video later, the
  app remembers where you were.

- name: label/title for the video
  - empty until set my user
  - auto-population from YouTube metadata requires the YouTube Data API

- looping: boolean; whether looping is currently enabled. The scratch-loop's
  endpoints are always what the player uses when this is true. See the Looping
  Model section for the full scratch-loop policy.

- speed: playback speed; defaults to 1.0

- seek_delta: controls <Left>/<Right> seeks; defaults to 5 sec.

- speed_delta: controls amount that -/= alter the speed.

- chapters: array of Chapter entities

- sections: array of Section entities

- loops: array of Loop entities (includes the scratch-loop if present)

- marks: array of Mark entities

- jumps:
    - Persisted list of non-small navigational jumps, used for go-back
      navigation.
    - Persisted across sessions.
    - Stored on the video object.
    - Jump history max size: 40 entries.

- version: version number of current metadata scheme

## Chapter

- id: generated unique identifier

- name: user-defined label (e.g., "Windy and Warm"); required.

- start: start time (seconds)

- end: end time (seconds)

## Section

- id: generated unique identifier

- chapterId: ID of the Chapter this section belongs to; nullable.

- name: user label (e.g., "Intro", "Verse", "Solo"); optional. If absent, the
  UI displays a computed rank-order name (e.g., "#1") derived from position
  in timeline order. Not stored.

- time: the divider point (seconds); start of this section

- end: end time (seconds); optional. If stored, the section ends here and
  a gap zone exists between this point and the next divider (shown as gray
  on the timeline). If absent, end is derived at runtime from the next
  divider's time (or the video's effective end for the last section).
  Constraint: stored end must not exceed the next section's time.

## Loop

- id: generated unique identifier

- chapterId: ID of the Chapter this loop belongs to; nullable.

- name: user label (e.g., "outro-lick"); optional. If absent, the UI displays
  a computed rank-order name (e.g., "#2"). Not stored. The scratch-loop is
  displayed distinctly (e.g., "scratch"), not numbered.

- start: start time (seconds)

- end: end time (seconds)

- source: ID of the Section or Loop this was loaded from, or null if manually
  created. Present on the scratch-loop only; enables the save-back operation
  and the dirty indicator.

- is_scratch: boolean; true on the one scratch-loop entity. Needed because
  source can be null for a manually-created scratch-loop, making source alone
  insufficient to identify which Loop in the array is the scratch-loop.

## Mark

- id: generated unique identifier

- chapterId: ID of the Chapter this mark belongs to; nullable.

- name: user label; optional. If absent, the UI displays a computed rank-order
  name (e.g., "#1") derived from position in timeline order. Not stored.

- time: time point (seconds)
